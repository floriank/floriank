- 👋 Hi, I’m @floriank
- 👀 I’m interested in Elixir, Functional Programming in general and videogames.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning OpenAPI Standards :)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing in particular, but if you need help, holler.
- 📫 You can reach me on Twitter (@carhillion), Keybase.io (schnuffi), or via a PR against one of my repos :wink:
